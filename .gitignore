Python artifacts
pycache/*.pyc *.pyo *.pyd

Jupyter Notebook temporary files
.ipynb_checkpoints

Large model files (joblib, pkl)
Keep the final model, but ignore others and general large binaries
Since the model is small, only ignore general binaries
If the model was >100MB, use Git LFS, but for this project, standard tracking is fine.
Ignore common data files that might be generated
*.csv *.xlsx

Explicitly ignore common model saves
*.joblib *.pkl
